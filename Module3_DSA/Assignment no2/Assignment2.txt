Assignment-2
1) What is Recursion?
Ans:-Recursion is a process by which a function calls itself, 
The corresponding function is called as recursive function. 

2) List and Explain types of Recursion 
Ans:-Direct Recursion, Indirect Recursion, Tail Recursion, 
No Tail/ Head Recursion, Linear recursion, Tree Recursion.

3) Explain the data structures used to perform recursion? 
Ans:-Stack is the data structure used to perform recursion.
Explanation:
Because of its LIFO (Last In First Out) property, it remembers its ‘caller’ so 
knows whom to return when the function has to return. Recursion makes 
use of the system stack for storing the return addresses of the function calls.

Every recursive function has its equivalent iterative (non-recursive) function. 
Even when such equivalent iterative procedures are written, an explicit stack is to be used.


4)List the examples where recursion is used 
Ans:- Fibonacci sequence,Dictionary,Tower of Hanoi

5)Explain the difference between Recursion and Iteration, justify which to use when,Tail recursion?
Ans:-
Recursion is when a function calls itself within its code, thus repeatedly executing the instructions present inside it.

Iteration is when a loop repeatedly executes the set of instructions like "for" loops and "while" loops.
